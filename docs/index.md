## Learning outcomes

The participants can expect to know what kind of data they might receive, 
how the data looks and potential pitfalls which might arise that are 
specific to immunological problems. Furthermore, the participants will 
have a base understanding of the expected cell types and their function 
in these datasets as well as understand the complexity of the immune system. 
Lastly, we will choose three cutting edge research topics to demonstrate 
how the methods are used and how the challenges in the analysis present 
themselves. 

## Learning experiences

To reach the learning outcomes we will use lectures, exercises, polls and group work. During exercises, you are free to discuss with other participants. During lectures, focus on the lecture only.

### Exercises

Each block has practical work involved. Some more than others. The practicals are subdivided into chapters, and we'll have a (short) discussion after each chapter. All answers to the practicals are incorporated, but they are hidden. Do the exercise first by yourself, before checking out the answer. If your answer is different from the answer in the practicals, try to figure out why they are different.

### Asking questions
During lectures, you are encouraged to raise your hand if you have questions.
We will also provide a Google doc where questions can be asked.
