With this course you will be introduced in generating a course website by using `mkdocs` and github pages. To get you started you are asked to bring some **course material of your own** that you can use to start generating your own course website. This course material can be:

- Exercises (in pdf, commented code or markdown)
- Presentations (pdf or powerpoint)
- Other text and images

You will be working on your own computer during the course. Make sure you have an account on [github](https://github.com/). Before the start of the course please install:

- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [`python (>3.5)`](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- `pip` (usually included in a `python` installation)
- `mkdocs`. Instructions [here](https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation)
- `mkdocs-material`. Instructions [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/#installation)

For the impatient (that already have a `git`, `python` and `pip` installation):

```sh
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-material
```
